// //  QNO:15

// // Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

// // • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.

// // • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

// // • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.

// // More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.

// // let guestlist=["saba","noreen","naila","musfira","mehru", "muntaha"]
// //  let canNotAttend:string = "noreen"
// //  console.log(canNotAttend + '' + "can not make it for dinner ");

//  let newGuest:string ="mahru"
//  guestlist[guestlist.indexOf(canNotAttend)] =newGuest;


// guestlist.map((item)=>
// console.log(`dear ${item}, you are cordinally invited to dinner`))
